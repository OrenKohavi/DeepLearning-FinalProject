# DeepLearning-FinalProject
Final Project for Deep Learning (CSCI1470) Spring '22 Semester

To run preprocessing:
run create_data.py, which will create the 'data' folder.
Within the 'data' folder, the four '.npy' files are numpy arrays corresponding to inputs/labels for testing & training. These can be opened using 'np.load(filename)'
optionally, if 'ouptut_image_previews' is set to 'True' in the code, it will also create 1000 jpeg inputs/labels for debugging or viewing.
